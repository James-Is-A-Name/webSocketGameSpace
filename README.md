# Web socket game thing

A multi-display multi-user controlled space using web sockets.

Being used for testing a possible simple game enviroment setup

setup now to just work on a local machine. node server/index.js then connect to the ip at probably 3000

Possible future plans
* alter to be a generic base for distibuted interactive things. e.g. make a solid API for inter browser comms
	- alter the controller to be a generic state tracked system
